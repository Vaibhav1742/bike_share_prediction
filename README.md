# Bike Share Prediction - ML Project

## Problem Statement

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from
membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, users are able to
easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about
over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today,
there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health
issues. Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data
being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research.
